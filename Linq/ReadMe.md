1. For the month of March, list the total earnings per employee along with the number of shifts, the regular earnings, and overtime earnings.

    **Note 1:** Remember that handling DateTime and TimeSpan calculations is best done in-memory; therefore, you should use a .ToList() in your linq's `from` clause so that the linq query is not converted to SQL.  

    **Note 2:** When doing your earnings calculations, remember that it's permissible to use method syntax inside of your linq query syntax.
